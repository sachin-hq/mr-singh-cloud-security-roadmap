# P00-D07 — Credentials vs Identity (Impersonation Reality)

## One-line anchor
Identity is who you are. Credentials are proof. Attackers steal proof and become you.

## Key learning
- Credentials can be stolen, so "authenticated" doesn't mean "legitimate"
- Impersonation is the real cloud attack
- Controls: MFA + short sessions + least privilege + key rotation + anomaly detection + audit logs
